It seems like there can be a lot of benefits to having a personal blog: practising writing technique, saving notes and snippets for later use, helping to enforce new knowledge and ideas, and even financial benefits if the blog attracts a large enough audience.

For me, the reason for this blog is point three, with a little bit of point two. While becoming a better writer would be nice, being a technical writer isn't something I'm very interested in (and although it would be nice to have a little bit of extra income, that's far from the expectation I have for this blog).

So yeah, the idea behind this blog is for me to just have a space where I can form new ideas into my own words in an attempt to commit them to long term memory, as well as host little snippets of code or ideas that I may continue to find useful throughout my time as a programmer.
